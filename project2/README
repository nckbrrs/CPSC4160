Project description: (Also, what image did you draw?)
 - Get familiar with SDL and C++ classes and make a simple drawing. I drew the "Impossible Triangle"

The easiest part of this project:
 - Actually drawing the shapes once I had the classes built

Problems that I had in completing this project:
 - Figuring out where to start (i.e. what kind of class am I supposed to make?)
 - Still a little confused about what is a renderer, what is a window, what is a frame, etc.
 - Generated Bitmap is all-black despite rendering correctly when running the program
    - I tried using the new FrameGenerator that you sent us but it caused my program to have a segfault...
