Project description:
	- Beginning to build a playable game with:
    - player object
    - HUD
    - AI
    - collision detection

Idea for game in future:
  - In the game I have in mind, you will control a Corgi with a jetpack,
    while cats with jetpacks are trying to shoot you and kill you. Your goal
    will be to shoot and destroy all of the evil cats before dying.
  - You'll control the Corgi using WASD for a typical up, left, down, right
    style of motion. You will have a jetpack.
  - My sprite source is me--I have create and will continue to create all of my
    art on my own from scratch.
  - The game will end when either: 1) you die, or 2) you kill all the evil cats.
