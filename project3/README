What sprite did I repeat at least 7 times?
	- Cloud

What sprite (not Sprite or MultiSprite) did I design?
	- TwoWayMultiSprite: Stickman (stickman.png)

The easiest part of this project:
	- Designing the sprites

Problems that I had in completing this project:
	- Ambiguous requirements (still not sure what was wrong with my initial attempt)
	- Figuring out how to make everything work natively on macOS, as well as
    understanding what was safe for me to edit and not edit. Took a while to
    simply figure out what each file was doing.
