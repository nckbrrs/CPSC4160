Project description:
  - BECOME FAMILIAR WITH INHERITANCE AND POLYMORPHISM,
    FACTORY AND SINGLETON PATTERNS, DATA-DRIVEN PROGRAMMING,
    AND THE TRACKER FRAMEWORK

What sprite did I repeat at least 7 times?
  - Smiley

What sprite (not Sprite or MultiSprite) did I design?
  - TwoWaySprite, a sprite that faces either forwards or backwards depending
    on which direction it is moving

The easiest part of this project:
  - Drawing the sprites

Problems that I had in completing this project:
  - Figuring out how to make everything work natively on macOS, as well as
    understanding what was safe for me to edit and not edit. Took a while to
    simply figure out what each file was doing.
