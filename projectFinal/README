Pizzazz / Personal Notes:
  - I drew everything you see from scratch (all sprites and animations, including explosions)
  - I created the song that is playing in the background from scratch
  - I implemented a health bar that follows the player and updates when the player is hit
  - I implemented a starting screen, as well as "You Win!" and "You Lose!" screens
